# GoLocal
A submission for the annual HackCMU Hackathon. We built a website which connects shopper with local businesses. The goal is to drive consumers to support local businesses. The web application includes a fully fledged out backend where users can share their favorit local businesses, and a beautiful front-end for finding what local businesses sell different products.

# Front-end
We developed our front-end using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with the popular BootStrap framework.

# Back-end
We developed our back-end using Django, implementing a relational database and building a RestFul API.

Thank you to HackCMU's organizers and to the many sponsers!
